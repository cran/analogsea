\title{R client for Digital Ocean}
\description{
This package is an R client for Digital Ocean's RESTful API, and a set
of scripts that allow you to install R, RStudio server, RStudio Shiny server, or
OpenCPU server, in addition to common packages used. The goal here is to spin up a
cloud R environment without leaving R, and requiring no knowledge other than R. Of
course if you are more experienced you can log in on the command line and modify
anything you want, but for those that just want a quick cloud R environment, this
should be one of the easiest options.

You need to authenticate to use this package. Get your auth token at
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications. See \code{\link{do_oauth}}
for more on authentication.
